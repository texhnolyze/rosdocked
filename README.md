## rosdocked

Run ROS Kinetic / Ubuntu Xenial within Docker on any platform with a shared username,
home directory, and X11. For ROS Melodic, switch to the respective branch.

This enables you to build and run a persistent ROS Kinetic workspace as long as
you can run Docker images.

Note that any changes made outside of your home directory from within the Docker environment will not persist. If you want to add additional binary packages or remove some of the dependencies that are currently installed, change the Dockerfile accordingly and rebuild.

For more info on Docker see here: https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/ubuntulinux/

### Build

This will create the image with your user/group ID and home directory.

```
./build
```

### Run

This will run the docker image.

```
./run
```

The image shares it's network interface with the host, so you can run this in
multiple terminals for multiple hooks into the docker environment.

Additionally, a video device is shared with the container. This video device can be set in the `run` script and will appear in the container as `/dev/video0`.
